                Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs
                and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order", with dominant
                individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a tempor
                ary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an
